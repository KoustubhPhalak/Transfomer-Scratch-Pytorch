# Transfomer-Scratch-Pytorch
Transformer from 'Attention is all you need' implemented from scratch in Pytorch.

For training, I use the Europarl German-English training corpus. By training the transformer for 10 epochs, I roughly observe around 25-30 BLEU score, which is in the expected range of the original paper (28.4 BLEU score). The corpus can be downloaded [here](https://www.statmt.org/europarl/v7/de-en.tgz). For more language pair data, one can check [this link](https://www.statmt.org/europarl/)
