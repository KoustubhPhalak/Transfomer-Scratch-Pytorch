# Transfomer-Scratch-Pytorch
Transformer from 'Attention is all you need' implemented from scratch in Pytorch.

For training, I use the Europarl German-English training corpus. By training the transformer for 10 epochs, I roughly observe around 25-30 BLEU score, which is in the expected range of the original paper (28.4 BLEU score).
